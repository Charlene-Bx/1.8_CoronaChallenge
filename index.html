    <h3>What Is Coronavirus?</h3>
    <p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.<p>
    <p>Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recotver without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness.</p>
    <h4>How is COVID-19 diagnosed?</h4>
    <p>Dianosis may be difficult with only a physical exam because mild cases of COVID-19 may appear similar to the flu or a bad cold. A laboratory test can confirm the diagnosis.</p>
    <h4>How is COVID-19 treated?</h4>
    <p>As of now, there is not a specific treatment for the virus. People who become sick from COVID-19 should be treated with supportive measures: those that relieve symptoms. For severe cases, there may be additional options for treatment, including research drugs and therapeutics.</p>
